NM-TRAN MESSAGES
  
 WARNINGS AND ERRORS (IF ANY) FOR PROBLEM    1
             
 (WARNING  2) NM-TRAN INFERS THAT THE DATA ARE POPULATION.
             
 (WARNING  79) SIGMA IS USED ON THE RIGHT. WITH A SUBSEQUENT RUN, IF AN
 INITIAL ESTIMATE OF A DIAGONAL BLOCK OF SIGMA IS TO BE COMPUTED BY
 NONMEM, THAT BLOCK WILL BE SET TO AN IDENTITY MATRIX DURING THAT
 COMPUTATION. THIS COULD LEAD TO AN ARITHMETIC EXCEPTION.*

 * THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF WARNINGS OF ONE OR MORE TYPES WAS REACHED.
 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME WARNING MESSAGES WERE SUPPRESSED.
  
Note: Analytical 2nd Derivatives are constructed in FSUBS but are never used.
      You may insert $ABBR DERIV2=NO after the first $PROB to save FSUBS construction and compilation time
