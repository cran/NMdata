  linesep = "\\n",
  simplify = TRUE,
  col.model,
  modelname,
  as.one
)
}
\arguments{
\item{as.one}{If the `file` argument is used and if `as.one` is
TRUE, the file(s) are read and put into a `data.table` with a
model column and a `text` column. Default is FALSE. Be careful
with this, as it returns different formats whether the `file`
or the `lines` argument is used.}
